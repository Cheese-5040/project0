Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
<!-- write up for the pages that i made -->
I created four webpages with links to navigate between each other using skills learnt in the course. 

index0:
This is a html page that represents the main page of the 4 html sheets. I used css to provide styling for the table, and added hyperlinks inside for easy navigation between webpages. Margins, padding, text size, text alignment, border are used in the css file as formatting.

index1:
This is the page that includes a short introduction of myself. I added a picture and more formatting for index1.css, such as aligning the picture to fit the middle of the webpage. Buttons are included to go back to the main page. Another table is also below for navigation to any other page in the repository.

index2:
Index2 is a more responsive webpage that shows my common interests. I had included bootstrap into the styling of the webpage, so that it is mobile friendly for the columns in a small screen.  An alert class messege is also used in this page.

index3:
Index3 implements sass inside the formatting of the webpage, and includes a form of nesting for the paragraph and unordered list on the page. An example of inheritance is also used in the formatting, as %messege is implemented in the sass file. @media query is also included in this html, making the colors of the text green if the screen window is minimised below 900 pixels.
