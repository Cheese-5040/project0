                            Hello everyone!  I am Ow Yong Chee Seng, a year 1 student pursuing his undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering.
                            I am interested to become a full stack programmer, thus I took CS50 course and it is my first time doing a functional webpage.
                            I hope that you like it!
                        </p>
